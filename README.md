# Schedulit - Event Manager Agent 
> ðŸ›  Built at BuildAI Hackathon, Seoul

Schedulit simplifies the overwhelming task of event planning and discovery.

At ETH Seoul, like many major conferences, the abundance of side events creates a paradox of choice â€” making it hard to decide where to go and what to prioritize. Our agent addresses this challenge by automating the event discovery process tailored to each user's background, interests, and availability.

Built using [Near AI](app.near.ai/), a decentralized AI agent platform.

## âœ¨ What It Does

Schedulit helps users:

- Discover relevant side events effortlessly
- Receive personalized recommendations
- Optimize their time and attendance based on personal goals

## ðŸš€ Deploy a new agent

> Note: we use a deploy script instead of CLI as we have cache folder and cannot ignore it when pushing the code on near.
